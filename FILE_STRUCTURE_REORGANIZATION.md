# File System Reorganization Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive file system reorganization completed for the Graphene Segmentation Project. The reorganization was designed to support multiple model versions and provide a cleaner, more maintainable project structure.

## Goals of Reorganization
1. **Version Control**: Support multiple model versions (v1, v2, v3, v4) for tracking improvements
2. **Clean Structure**: Organize files into logical directories based on their purpose
3. **Maintainability**: Make it easier to add new models and compare different approaches
4. **Scalability**: Prepare the project for future enhancements and research iterations

### Moved to `models/v1_2dmoinet/`
- `train_2dmoinet.py` → `models/v1_2dmoinet/train_2dmoinet.py`
- `test_2dmoinet.py` → `models/v1_2dmoinet/test_2dmoinet.py`
- `dataset.py` → `models/v1_2dmoinet/dataset.py`
- `transforms.py` → `models/v1_2dmoinet/transforms.py`

### Moved to `utils/`
- `enhanced_preprocess.py` → `utils/enhanced_preprocess.py`
- `enhanced_augmentation.py` → `utils/enhanced_augmentation.py`
- `create_quadrant_dataset.py` → `utils/create_quadrant_dataset.py`

### Moved to `scripts/`
- `run_pipeline.py` → `scripts/run_pipeline.py`

### Moved to `data/raw/`
- `images/` → `data/raw/images/`
- `masks/` → `data/raw/masks/`
- `annotations/` → `data/raw/annotations/`

### Moved to `data/processed/`
- `quadrant_dataset/` → `data/processed/quadrant_dataset/`

### Moved to `data/augmented/`

## Code Updates Made

### Path Updates
All scripts were updated to use the new directory structure:
- Updated `models/v1_2dmoinet/train_2dmoinet.py` to use `project_root` paths
- Updated `models/v1_2dmoinet/test_2dmoinet.py` to use `project_root` paths
- Updated `utils/enhanced_preprocess.py` to use new data paths
- Updated `utils/enhanced_augmentation.py` to use new data paths
- Updated `utils/create_quadrant_dataset.py` to use new data paths

### Import Updates
- Updated all relative imports to reflect new package structure
- Added `project_root` path resolution for robust file handling
- Updated script execution paths in pipeline scripts

## Benefits of New Structure

### 1. Version Management
- Clear separation between different model versions
- Easy to compare performance across versions
- Simple to add new versions without affecting existing ones

### 2. Maintainability
- Logical grouping of related files
- Clear separation of concerns (data, models, utilities, results)
- Easier to locate specific functionality

### 3. Scalability
- Ready for additional model versions
- Easy to add new preprocessing or augmentation techniques
- Structured for team collaboration

### 4. Research Workflow
- Clear pipeline from data preparation to results
- Easy to track changes and improvements
- Better organization for academic documentation

## Usage After Reorganization

### Running the Pipeline
```bash
# From project root
python scripts/run_pipeline.py

# Run single step
python scripts/run_pipeline.py --step train
```

### Training a Model
```bash
# From project root
python models/v1_2dmoinet/train_2dmoinet.py
```

### Testing a Model
```bash
# From project root
python models/v1_2dmoinet/test_2dmoinet.py
```

### Running Utilities
```bash
# Create quadrant dataset
python utils/create_quadrant_dataset.py

# Preprocess images
python utils/enhanced_preprocess.py

# Augment data
python utils/enhanced_augmentation.py
```

## Future Enhancements

### Adding New Model Versions
1. Create new directory: `models/v2_enhanced/`
2. Copy and modify files from previous version
3. Update paths and imports
4. Add new checkpoints and results directories

### Adding New Utilities
1. Place in appropriate `utils/` subdirectory
2. Update pipeline scripts if needed
3. Ensure path compatibility

### Data Pipeline Extensions
1. Add new preprocessing steps in `utils/`
2. Extend augmentation techniques
3. Update data flow documentation

## Verification
The reorganization has been verified by:
- Testing the main pipeline script (`scripts/run_pipeline.py`)
- Confirming all file paths are correctly updated
- Verifying that the existing trained models and results are preserved
- Ensuring the directory structure supports the intended workflow

## Conclusion
The file system reorganization successfully transforms the project from a flat, single-version structure to a well-organized, version-controlled, and scalable architecture. This new structure will significantly improve the project's maintainability and support future research iterations and model improvements.

The reorganization maintains all existing functionality while providing a solid foundation for:
- Adding new model versions
- Implementing additional preprocessing techniques
- Expanding the dataset pipeline
- Collaborating with research teams
- Publishing research results

All existing models, checkpoints, and results have been preserved and are now properly organized for future use and comparison.
